To participate in this workshop, you will need access to the **bash** shell, as well as a copy of the sample data files.

For information on accessing the shell on your laptop and downloading the sample data, see the [materials](https://duke-gcb.github.io/2019-08-12-Duke/#materials) section on our workshop page.

Before we can use the data, we must

1. Download the [shell_data.zip](./data/shell_data.zip) file
2. Extract its contents - a `shell_data` folder (double-click the file if your browser didn't extract it automatically).
3. Move the folder to your home directory (e.g. `/Users/dan` or `C:\Users\Dan`)
